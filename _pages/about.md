I am a Ph.D. candidate in Systems Engineering at the City University of Hong Kong. My research interests lie in transportation infrastructure, with a focus on pavement damage detection based on Vision Language Models and Computer Vision. Over the course of my academic journey, I have published 10 journal articles and 3 conference paper with total 240 citations, which have been published in prestigious venues such as *Comput.-Aided Civil Infrastruct. Eng.*, *Autom. Constr.*, and *IEEE Trans. Intell. Transp. Syst.* and so on.
